/**
 * Author: Lucas Carpenter
 * Program #: 4 Task Management App
 * C243 - Data Structures
 * Date: 4/16/2025
 * Description: This Java program functions as a simple task management app that uses a priority queue to 
 * organize tasks based on their priority, where lower numbers mean higher priority. When tasks are added, 
 * the upheap method ensures the queue stays sorted, and when tasks are removed, the downheap method 
 * maintains the correct order. The app allows users to add new tasks, view the highest-priority task, 
 * and remove tasks once completed. It also handles errors like trying to peek or remove from an empty queue. 
 * A test class is included to demonstrate how tasks are added and removed in action.

import java.util.Scanner;           // Import the scanner class.

// The PriorityQueue implements a priority queue ADT using an array to store the tasks and their priorities.
// The PriorityQueue class is a custom data structure that organizes tasks based on their priority, using an 
// array-backed implementation. Each task is assigned a numerical priority, with lower numbers representing 
// higher priority. When tasks are added, the class uses the upHeap method to maintain the correct order, 
// ensuring that the highest-priority task is always at the front. When tasks are removed, the downHeap method 
// reorganizes the remaining tasks to preserve the queueâ€™s structure. This allows users to efficiently add, view, 
// and remove tasks in priority order, making it ideal for task management applications where urgent items 
// need to be handled first. The PriorityQueue class in this program manages tasks with methods like add(), remove(), 
// peek(), and heap maintenance methods such as upheap() and downheap() to efficiently maintain the heap property for 
// prioritized task management.
